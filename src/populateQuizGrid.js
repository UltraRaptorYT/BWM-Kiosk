Is it the path to remove suffering and attain happiness? If so, how much time will we devote in studying the scriptures? If it is the way to go, then what kind of path is it? For if suffering and happiness arise from inverted perception and erroneous views, then reversing the erroneous views becomes the most important task. Then whose language, whose persuasion, whose speech, and whose scriptures can help correct our flaws within? The answer is “Dharma – Buddha’s teaching!” What function does the teaching provide?

In times the case of crises, this friend will for sure lend his/her helping hands, or even to the extent of sacrificing himself/herself. Such is the most unforgettable friend and the most worthy one! Hence, we not only like to befriend this type of person but we would also like them from the bottom of our hearts. How nice is it to have such a friend in our lives!

If we believed that we only had this one short life—whether it goes well or badly—then once it’s over, that’s it. There would be nothing more to discuss. But in reality, life is an infinite continuation, and we must be certain about this. This has two key implications: first, only when we’re sure of this does it make sense to truly change ourselves. Second, most people today don’t consider or discuss this issue—especially the mainstream scientific community, which generally does not accept the concept. That’s why I feel it’s important to bring it up and talk about it.",
